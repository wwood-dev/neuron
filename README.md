## Description ##

The NeuronMain product is designed to control peripheral devices that use simple low-speed interfaces or slowly changing signals. The board uses the following CMOS signal levels: + 3V â€“ "1" and 0V â€“ "0".

The board has 136 digital contacts capable to operate for both sending a pre-set level and receiving it (switching is carried out in real-time from a computer). The signal switching frequency is up to 290 times per second at an RS-232 exchange rate of 115,200 baud, and it is limited by the RS-232 interface throughput, that is, when using controllers with a higher transmission rate, the maximum signal switching frequency will multiply. ADC/DAC that uses a parallel code can be connected to some of the digital contacts to obtain the ability to send or receive analog signals.

The Cyclone IV E EP4CE10F17C8 programmable logic device (PLD) is applied to the board. The project for the PLD is developed in the Intel (Altera) Quartus 11 environment; any version of this environment that supports the specified PLD can be used for compilation.
